Change the achieving condition of progress "Killed by Void Monster" to "kill Void Monster" instead of "die due to Void Monster": Dying system of ManaMetal will cause the original condition not able to be satisfied. See questing line for more information.
Add a recipe for getting ender crystal: There is no ender crystal because Mana Metal changes world generation of the end. See questing line for more information.
